    <string name="mafiaPlayDescription">
        Welcome to Mafia game. To be able to play like a pro you need to master the basic controls as well as basic idea of the game-play. So without further ado let\'s get started.
    \n\n
    The game is divided into 2 main categories : Classic Mafia, and \'Yakudza\' also known as Doctor and Maniac Players game.
        \n\n
        For now the \'Yakudza\' game is not available and will be released soon so we are going to discuss the basis of the Classic game type.
        \nThe game consists of minimum 9 players : at least 3 mafia players with at least 1 KingPin and the rest are citizen players with at least 1 Sheriff player.
        \n The purpose of the Mafia player is to eliminate citizens and try to negotiate with them as if he/she was citizen too,thus the mafia player has a little more advantage of shooting a
        desired player during the night.
        \nThe idea of the citizen players is to eliminate all of the mafia members to win,as simple as it gets.
        \n\n
        <b>The Role of Mafia Players:</b>
        \n\n
        There are 3 mafia players as stated and all of them must shoot same person during the night. As soon as night has come,the mafia player will have ability to talk to each other in global
        chat so the citizens will not see their conversation. At that point,until the morning,all of the mafia members are obliged to shoot the same person, so the person will be counted as eliminated.
        If even one of them did not shot the same person,the shooting will be counted as missed and the citizen will be playing for another morning.
        Here are the scenarios where mafia will be counted as won when the below mentioned count of players with concrete roles are left:
        1) Mafia-2,citizen-1
        2) Mafia-3,citizen-2
        3) Mafia-1,citizen-1
        \n
        In all of these cases the mafia is considered to be a winner.
        \n\n
        The citizens are winning only in the case of all mafia members to be eliminated through voting.
        \n\n\
        <b>The KingPing Role:</b>
        \n\n
        Basically talking about the Head of Mafia Players, we can say that the KingPin is the one who is deciding the victim for the night.

        \n\n
        <b>The Sheriff Role:</b>
        \n\n
        The Ultimate help for citizens is the Sheriff Role. Sheriff can check one player each night to see that player\'s role,whether the player is from mafia the player is citizen.

        \n\n
        <b>The Voting:</b>
        \n\n
        During the morning all of the players can vote by posting a vote candidate with the click of the desired participant in the room. Even mafia can vote and make voting. This is the
        only tool for citizens to eliminate the mafia player.

        \n\n
        <b>The Ending:</b>
        \n\n
        At the end of the game,the winner players will be rewarded with concrete price which will vary from time to time.

        \n\n\n
        Enjoy you\'r time! Wish you good luck!
